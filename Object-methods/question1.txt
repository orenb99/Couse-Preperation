Here the function makeUser returns an object.

What is the result of accessing its ref? Why?

function makeUser() {
  return {
    name: "John",
    ref: this
  };
}

let user = makeUser();

alert( user.ref.name ); // What's the result?

Answer:
error because in the function the this references to an object that doesn't exist and becomes undefined,
and undefined variables doesn't have properties.
